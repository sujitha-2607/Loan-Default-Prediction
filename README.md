# Loan Default Prediction – Automating Bank Credit Processes Using AI

This project applies AI and machine learning to predict whether a customer is likely to default on a loan, enabling banks to make informed and automated credit decisions.

---

## Problem Statement

Banks often struggle to accurately assess credit risk and loan default probability. This project automates that process by using classification models to predict default based on applicant data.

---

## Key Features

- Predicts loan defaults using historical banking data
- Compares multiple ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
- Evaluates models via ROC-AUC, F1 score, Precision, and Recall
- Provides explainability with **SHAP** (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
- Visualization of feature importance and model decisions
- End-to-end pipeline from data preprocessing to model interpretation

---

## Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **scikit-learn**
- **XGBoost**
- **SHAP**
- **pandas**, **matplotlib**, **seaborn**
